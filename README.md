# bundles-demo

This is a preliminary demonstration of Bundles 2.0 - a new system for creating Git based code which can run within the Expression environment.

The audience for thie repo is primarily existing users of Expression who may be looking to migrate existing bundles two the new 2.0 model. 

Bundles 2.0 fully supports Git "out of the box" and allows you as a developer to manage your own code workflow, while still leveraging the power of the broad toolset that the Expression platform provides.

## What is Expression?

Expression is a platform for delivering websites, e-stores and custom applications. It's a fully hosted service with 15+ years of development behind it - used worldwide.

Find us over at [expression.cloud](https://expression.cloud)

## Where can I see it in action?

You can see a live version of this repository running over at the [Expression Bundles 2.0 Demo Page](https://bundles-demo.xpr.cloud/)

## Sorry, I'm confused?

Bare with us :) The Bundles 2 Beta -- and this "living documentation" is still under progress. If you've never heard of Expression before, consider signing up over at [expression.cloud](https://expression.cloud) and giving it a test-drive! Take a look at the live demo and you'll likely get some insights into how we think about building projects with Expression. 

If you're an existing Expression user looking to learn the new system, I suggest cloning down the repo, and taking a look at both `template.hbs` in `xpr/element` and `template.json` in `xpr/element_config`.

## Any questions?

If you've got any questions, I'd love to hear from you and have a conversation? Don't be shy! You can find me over at: <devon@expression.cloud>
